# calculator
This is a tiny simple On-screen javascript calculator i have made for practice while learning java-script. 
I have tried my best to check for any possible issues with the way it works, but if you find anything i missed, feel free to reach out and tell me, i'll be really grateful.
The code myight need some optimization, but so far it just does what it must :)
